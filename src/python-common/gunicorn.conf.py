    # The BatchSpanProcessor is not fork-safe and doesnâ€™t work well

    # the pre-fork web server model. The BatchSpanProcessor spawns
    # a thread to run in the background to export spans to the
    # telemetry backend. During the fork, the child process
    # inherits the lock which is held by the parent process and
    # deadlock occurs. We can use fork hooks to get around this
    # limitation of the span processor.
